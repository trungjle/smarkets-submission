# Smarkets Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the assignment for Smarkets.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- React Query (fetching API)
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:
npm install
npm run dev

## Configuration
Please run https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com before starting the application

## Features

- Created a dashboard similar to the Smarkets app
- Added routes to navigate to each sporting event

## Approach

I aimed to design something similar to the Smarkets website. I chose React because of my familiarity with it and incorporated relevant technologies that I'm comfortable with.

## Challenges

- Dealing with the CORS issue was challenging as I had not encountered it before. Eventually, I resolved it by using the proxy server via https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
- Fetching the API was complex due to the limited documentation, prompting me to simplify the implementation.

## Future Improvements

- Implement backend code to act as a web server and handle CORS issues effectively.
- Customize the app to match the Smarkets color scheme and refactor the styling.
- Enhance test coverage for better reliability.
- Increased test coverage.
- Used more API endpoints.
